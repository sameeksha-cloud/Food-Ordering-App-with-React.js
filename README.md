## Implementation
This project uses Create App tool , React Hook concepts, JavaScript ES6 and CSS.

1. **Create App tool :** It's a React toolchain we have used this toolchain inorder to build a single page application. It just creates a frontend build pipeline,
so you can use it with any backend you want.

2. **React Hooks :** They are in-built functions that allow to use state and life cycle methods within the components in React. We have used some built-in hooks like useContext(), useEffect(), useRef() and useReducer().
  
    **useContext() :** To make sure that data can be added or items can be added to the cart. To manage the overall cart data through context because we will need it in different places of the
    application. We need data in the header where "Your Cart" is defined and also on summary meals.

    **useReducer() :** It is for state managment. Any components affected by the context are re-evaluated whenever the cart data changes. We are using this instead of useState because we were having a bit of a more complex state, which we're managing here
    because we'll have to check whether a meal is already part of the cart or not and for removing item from the cart.

    **useRef() :** To extract the entered amount for meal items we have used ref. It allows us to persist values between renders and does not cause a re-render when amount value will be updated.

    **useEffect() :** utilizing useEffect to play the animation when items are added to the cart or removed from the cart.
 
 3. **ES6 Features :** Used features like arrow functions to construct component functions, findindex() method inorder to update the item amount or remove the item from the cart, filter method to return new array items , let variables 
  
 4. **CSS :** Used for styling the application.
